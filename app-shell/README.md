# Opentrons Desktop Shell

[![JavaScript Style Guide][style-guide-badge]][style-guide]

> Desktop application wrapper for the [Opentrons App](../app) using Electron

## overview

This directory contains the code for the [Electron main process][electron-main] that runs the Opentrons application.

## developing

To get started: clone the Opentrons/opentrons repository, set up your computer for development as specified in the [project readme][project-readme-setup], and then:

``` shell
# prerequisite: install dependencies as specified in project setup
make install
# change into the app-shell directory
cd app-shell
# install dependencies
make install
# launch the electron app in dev mode
make dev
```

You probably want to be developing from the [app directory](../app) instead. Its `make dev` task will automatically call `make dev` here in `app-shell`.

## stack and structure

The desktop application shell uses:

*   [Electron][]
*   [Electron Builder][electron-builder]

## testing

The desktop shell has no tests at this time.

## building

This section details production build instructions for the desktop application.

### build dependencies

`electron-builder` requires some native dependencies to build and package the app (see [the electron-builder docs][electron-builder-platforms]).

*   macOS - None
*   Windows - None
*   Linux - icnsutils, graphicsmagick, and xz-utils

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y icnsutils graphicsmagick xz-utils
    ```

### build tasks

*   `make` - Default target is "clean package"
*   `make clean` - Delete the dist folder
*   `make package` - Creates a production package of the app for running and inspection (does not create a distributable)

#### production builds

All packages and/or distributables will be placed in `app-shell/dist`. After running `make package`, you can launch the production app with:

*   macOS: `./dist/mac/Opentrons.app/Contents/MacOS/Opentrons`
*   Linux: `./dist/linux-unpacked/opentrons`
*   Windows: `./dist/win-unpacked/Opentrons.exe`

To run the production app in debug mode, set the `DEBUG` environment variable. For example, on macOS:

```shell
DEBUG=1 ./dist/mac/Opentrons.app/Contents/MacOS/Opentrons
```

#### ci

There are a series of tasks designed to be run in CI to create distributable versions of the app.

*   `make dist-osx` - Create a macOS distributable of the app
*   `make dist-linux` - Create a Linux distributable of the app
*   `make dist-posix` - Create macOS and Linux apps simultaneously
*   `make dist-win` - Create a Windows distributable of the app

These tasks need the following environment variables defined:

 name          | description   | why
-------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------
 OT_BRANCH     | Branch name   | Sets the release channel
 OT_BUILD      | Build number  | Appended to the artifact name
 OT_BUCKET_APP | AWS S3 bucket | Artifact deploy bucket
 OT_FOLDER_APP | AWS S3 folder | Artifact deploy folder in bucket

The release channel is set according to:

1.  Is `$OT_BRANCH` set to `master`?
    *   If yes, channel is `stable`
2.  Is `$OT_BRANCH` set to `edge`?
    *   If yes, channel is `edge`
3.  Is `$OT_BRANCH` set to something else?
    *   If yes, channel is `$OT_BRANCH`
    *   Auto-update will be disabled
4.  Else, channel is `dev`
    *   Auto-update will be disabled
